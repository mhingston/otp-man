# OTP Manager

A simple OTP manager for desktop browsers. When launched it will ask for a password to encrypt any added OTP codes which are stored in `localStorage`. Click the floating action button at the bottom right and select an image file containing a QR code with an [OTP URL](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format). Your password is cleared from memory when the page is refreshed.
